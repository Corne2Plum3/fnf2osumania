It just started, sorry for bugs (and my bad english).
If you find a bug or a question, post an [issue](https://github.com/Corne2Plum3/fnf2osumania/issues).

## Required
If you don't have this, the program will not work.
* You need [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed on your computer, else it won't work.
* **Python 3.7** or newer. (I'm not sure with older versions of Python 3. Forget Python 2)
* These Python libraries, that can be downloaded using [pip](https://docs.python.org/fr/3.6/installing/index.html), some of them are already installed:
    * functools
    * json
    * math
    * os
    * pathlib
    * pydub
    * shutil
    * sys
    * tkinter
    * threading
    * trace
    * webbrowser
    * zipfile

## Using it
*I really should improve that...*

Download the source code and run `main.py`.

## Developping
